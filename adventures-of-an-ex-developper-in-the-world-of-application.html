      <p>management  </p>
<p>After more than one year as project manager on a portal for a new offer
in the cloud, some thoughts and impressions of this new experience :</p>
<h2>The good</h2>
<p>I was really impressed by the teams I met here.<br />
Even if always running out of time, most people take the time to
explain, guide you trough the maze of networks and processes and
tools.<br />
Event though I would have appreciated a sort of nearly impossible to
build ’welcome package’, I rarely felt dead-end in front of an
impossible solution.<br />
And of course, the technical and organizational skills were as high as I
could expect. (with enough decontraction and fun to put the pressure at
a reasonable level).<br />
Thanks to all for that !</p>
<p>As an old programmer, I am convinced of the importance of testing and
documentation, but it’s far more obvious when you manage an application
:</p>
<ul>
<li>rule1 : the environment is never the same as the developer’s one :
be prepared ! Test platforms are your friends : take care of them.  </li>
<li>rule2 : the installer is not a programmer and can’t aways adapt your
code to the platform : have a good and exhaustive documentation !</li>
</ul>
<h2>The bad</h2>
<p>Ok, no welcome package for the newcomer, but still the impression of a
multitude of tools, process, networks, sometimes for the same
functionality.<br />
The impression of learning to swim in a huge pool is sometimes strong.</p>
<dl>
<dt>As an ex-developper, I may have a biased perception in the make-vs-buy</dt>
<dt>debate.</dt>
<dt>Of course, we can’t always reinvent the wheel, we have to go fast on new</dt>
<dt>markets, and concentrate the effort on added-value.</dt>
<dt>But I still believe that a close proximity with coding experience allows</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>reactivity  </li>
<li>innovation  </li>
<li>better understanding of the technical limitations  </li>
<li>better response to end-user expectations  </li>
<li>less vendor lock-in</li>
</ul>
<h2>The ugly</h2>
<p>Most of the time, requesting a flow opening is a seamless experience,
but it may sometimes transform as the ugliest experience in your worst
nightmares.</p>
<p>As a naïve requester, I have no idea of the firewalls and networks
crossed by my IP packets (nothing about that in the welcome package).<br />
I would highly appreciate a single kiosk to post my request, with
network experts relaying the request from end-to-end.<br />
This would be more gratifying for everyone, and less time consuming !
(and better sleeping)</p>
<p>However, it’s still a great experience to deploy a portal for thousands
of users in the next years !</p>
