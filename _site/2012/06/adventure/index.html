<h1>Adventures of an (ex)-developper in the world of application management</h1>

<p>After more than one year as project manager on a portal for a new offer in the cloud, some thoughts and impressions of this new experience :</p>
<h2>The good</h2>
<p>I was really impressed by the teams I met here. <br />
Even if always running out of time, most people take the time to explain, guide you trough the maze of networks and processes and tools.<br />
Event though I would have appreciated a sort of nearly impossible to build &#8216;welcome package&#8217;, I rarely felt dead-end in front of an impossible solution.<br />
And of course, the technical and organizational skills were as high as I could expect. (with enough decontraction and fun to put the pressure at a reasonable level).<br />
Thanks to all for that !</p>
<p>As an old programmer, I am convinced of the importance of testing and documentation, but it&#8217;s far more obvious when you manage an application :<br />
- rule1 : the environment is never the same as the developer&#8217;s one : be prepared ! Test platforms are your friends : take care of them.<br />
- rule2 : the installer is not a programmer and can&#8217;t aways adapt your code to the platform : have a good and exhaustive documentation !</p>
<h2>The bad</h2>
<p>Ok, no welcome package for the newcomer, but still the impression of a multitude of tools, process, networks, sometimes for the same functionality.<br />
The impression of learning to swim in a huge pool is sometimes strong.</p>
<p>As an ex-developper, I may have a biased perception in the make-vs-buy debate. <br />
Of course, we can&#8217;t always reinvent the wheel, we have to go fast on new markets, and concentrate the effort on added-value.<br />
But I still believe that a close proximity with coding experience allows :<br />
- reactivity<br />
- innovation<br />
- better understanding of the technical limitations<br />
- better response to end-user expectations<br />
- less vendor lock-in</p>
<h2>The ugly</h2>
<p>Most of the time, requesting a flow opening is a seamless experience, but it may sometimes transform as the ugliest experience in your worst nightmares.</p>
<p>As a naïve requester, I have no idea of the firewalls and networks crossed by my IP packets (nothing about that in the welcome package).<br />
I would highly appreciate a single kiosk to post my request, with network experts relaying the request from end-to-end.<br />
This would be more gratifying for everyone, and less time consuming ! (and better sleeping)</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s still a great experience to deploy a portal for thousands of users in the next years !</p>
